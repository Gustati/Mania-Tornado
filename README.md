# Mania Tornado

This mod basically adds Tails' plane mania style, not only modifying the Intro but also the Outro.

Thanks ICloudius for helping me with the scripts :)

# Q&A
Q: Does it support Extra Slot Mighty?

A: Yes, there is a version called Sonic Plane, you can use both versions, but use Sonic Plane on top of Extra Slot Mighty and Mania Tornado on the bottom.

Q: Does it modify the tornado in the final cutscene?

A: Yes, but it modifies the characters' heads, maybe in the next update I will make the credits tornado modifiable.

Q: For some reason the Sonic Plane version is not working.

A: Make sure you have this order:
